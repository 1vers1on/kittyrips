# Unknown Firmware Rips
Firmware dumps from a variety of unknown devices.

If a file is not named `unknown*.bin`, its name corresponds to the flash chip it was extracted from. When multiple dumps are taken from different devices using the same type of chip, I add a `_*` suffix to make each dump distinct.
