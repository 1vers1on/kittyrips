# Kittyrips
A collection of cat-approved firmware rips.

This repository contains firmware dumps from various chips. Not everything here is strictly firmware, some may be configuration chips, but I havenâ€™t sorted them out yet.

The script `dump_consensus.py` is included to create a majority consensus from multiple dumps and attempt to recover any errors.
